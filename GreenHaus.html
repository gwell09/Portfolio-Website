                    A cozy yet mysterious gardening simulator set in an alien greenhouse, light-years away from Earth. In this one-week prototype, you have an inventory
                    full of strange seeds to cultivate bizarre flora, glowing fungi, and otherworldly plants that evolve based on your care. Experiment, nurture, and unlock
                    the secrets of interstellar botany in this out-of-this-world 3D gardening adventure. The universe is your gardenâ€”let's see what grows!

                    Ideation
                </h3>


                <p>
                    This was a one-week prototype I created to focus on environmental design and the implementation of an inventory system into a game. Based on an "Out of Time" theme, I
                    decided to make a game that kept track of the time, day, date, and season in response to this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This game is different from my other games because of the aesthetic and inclusion of in-world time. The time was also tampered with
                    so it would be a little faster as it may be on another planet.
                </p>

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, I wanted to create a relaxing game with a stunning view. I also wanted the player to feel a sense of exploration
                    with the variety of plants they could grow and curiosity towards this flora.

                    Environmental Design
                </h3>

                <p>
                    I focused on a purple and orange color palette because I wanted
                    to set this game apart from the traditional farming simulator by creating an ethereal, otherwordly aesthetic. I also had a very specific
                    idea for the greenhouse, so I designed it myself.

                    Timeline: 1 Week

                <p>
                    For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
                    However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.
                    The timeline for this game was one week:
                </p>

                <p>
                    10/20: Ideation, General development plan

                    Responsibilities
                </h3>

                <p>
                    All assets except green house model are not my own. Team size: 1 (solo project)
                </p>

                <p>
                    - Setting up time in game, creating inventory system and individual plants using scriptable objects
                </p>

                    - Environmental Design

                <p>
                    -  Creating function of plants growing according to time and ability to harvest
                </p>

                <p>
                    - Writing descriptions for items in inventory

                    Playtest Notes
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The playtesters thought the entire experience was really interesting due to the environment. However, they wished that the items in the inventory could be
                    cycled through quickly instead of having to open the inventory each time again when they were swapping something out. I agreed that this would be a great addition
                    to the game and could be implemented using the number pad.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some also wished there was something to do while they used the napping function when waiting for plants to grow. Something like a mini-game
                    could be sufficient or just making the time go even faster while napping. I thought the best and most interesting solution could be to set
                    up a camera within the scene so you could see the time passing through the sunset and sunrise.
                </p>

                <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                    Challenges
                </h3>

                <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                    The most difficult part of the development process in this game was creating the inventory. It was extremely tedious and a very time-consuming task.
                    However, I think having an inventory was a great addition because it is crucial in gardening games like this.
