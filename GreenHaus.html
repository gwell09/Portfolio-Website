            Green Haus is a gardening simulator with a twist. The player is in a green house on another planet far, far away and is able to grow a variety of flowers and fungi
            from their inventory.

            Ideation
        </h2>


        <p>
            This was a prototype I made for a learning exercise based on an "Out of Time" theme. I decided to make a game that kept track of the time, day, date, and season in response to this.
        </p>

        <p>
            This game is different from my other games because of this aesthetic and the inclusion of in-world time. This time was also tampered with
            so it would be a little faster as it may be on another planet. Below are
            some snippits of code, documentation of my ideation process, and a picture of my reference, Harvest Moon.
        </p>

            Emotions

        <p>
            Ultimately, I wanted to create a relaxing game with a stunning view. I also wanted the player to feel a sense of exploration
            with the variety of plants they could grow and curiosity towards this flora.
        </p>

            Environmental Design
        </h3>

        <p>
            I focused on a purple and orange color palette because I wanted
            to set this game apart from the traditional farming simulator by creating an ethereal, otherwordly aesthetic. I also had a very specific
            idea for the greenhouse, so I designed it myself.

            For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
            However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.

            Playtest Notes
        </h2>

        <p>
            The playtesters thought the entire experience was really interesting due to the environment. However, they wished that the items in the inventory could be
            cycled through quickly instead of having to open the inventory each time again when they were swapping something out. I agreed that this would be a great addition
            to the game and could be implemented using the number pad.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some also wished there was something to do while they used the napping function when waiting for plants to grow. Something like a mini-game
             could be sufficient or just making the time go even faster while napping. I thought the best and most interesting solution could be to set
             up a camera within the scene so you could see the time passing through the sunset and sunrise.

            Challenges
        </h2>

        <p>
            The most difficult part of the development process in this game was creating the inventory. It was extremely tedious and a very time-consuming task.
            However, I think having an inventory was a great addition because it is crucial in gardening games like this.
