                    Ideation
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Since I normally develop games in Unity, I designed this game to expand my knowledge of Unreal Engine. Its theme, "Home," inspired me to reflect on the five years I spent rowing,
                    from 8th grade through my senior year of high school.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I knew I wanted to design something with a focus on the narrative, so I began by writing a poem about the relationship between me and the lake I rowed on.
                    It's an artificial lake - there aren't many natural bodies of water in Texas. It's also incredibly polluted and was known to harbor dead bodies from time to time.
                    Needless to say, my team and I found it pretty foul. However, I spent so many beautiful sunsets and sunrises on this lake with
                    my closest friends and it changed me fundamentally. Some of my most precious memories were spent rowing in that polluted water. Below is the poem I wrote for this game with some
                    notes about player interaction to prompt scene changes:

                <h3>
                    Emotions
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I definitely took some creative liberties with this storyline compared to my own lived experiences. I intentionally left the end a little
                    ambiguous so that the player can draw their own conclusions. Some people may believe the player drowned themselves and others may think the player
                    simply found the connection they longed for. I was trying to create an air of mystery that is embedded in a
                    relaxing, pleasant experience that the player may feel like they are floating through at some times.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Inspiration
                </h3>

                <p>
                    My inspiration came from a game I discovered from the Bitsy Jam on Itch.io. "the mountain is as it always was" by Christine Mi, is
                    "a small narrative game about mountains, emptiness, loss, and remembering what it means to be alive." I liked the minimal interaction and the way it put
                    most of the focus on the writing. It was a short, but impactful and slightly haunting experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some other takeaways from this reference game that I included in mine were the typewriter style of text and the relaxing color scheme. Of course, I also may have been
                    inspired to write about nature, but took a different approach. Additionally, since this is a 2.5D game, which is a bit unusual, I added a very light pixelation effect to the post-
                    process volume to make the 2D pixel character fit in a little better.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        While I didn't get the chance to playtest this as much as I would have liked, those who did play it gave great reviews. They felt deeply immersed in the story and
                        environment. While there was minimal interaction, players thought it worked well since they primarily focused on the content of the poem and exploring the environment.

                        Challenges
                    </h3>

                    <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                        The greatest challenge for me in this game is that it was definitely a lot of work creating all of the scenes and making sure everything flowed together smoothly.
                        If I could have changed anything, I would have liked to have some kind of time and place aspect that would have been when the player would switch the scene. Currently, the
                        player just presses Y when the poetry from that scene is finished. It would have been great to have the player have to be near the boat when pressing Y to enter the boat for
                        instance.
