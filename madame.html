                Step into the flickering glow of a 1920s carnival, where fate is just a card flip away. In this one-week prototype, you enter the mysterious tent of Madame Vita,
                a fortune teller whose readings are never quite what they seem. Choose your cards, uncover cryptic messages, and watch as your destiny unfolds. Will you embrace
                the fortune you’re given, or attempt to change what’s already been written in the stars?

            </h3>

            <p>
                I designed this one week prototype to have fun with a very gothic, sultry aesthetic and to hone my illustration and writing skills. Based on the theme "Stacking," I decided to
                create a game centered around a fortune teller and her mysterious stack of cards.

                Emotions
            </h3>
            <p>
                For this game, I envisioned a very sultry, mysterious vibe. I created this kind of environment by taking a lot of inspiration from
                the 20s. I used royalty-free 20s ragtime music and images from carnivals in the early 1900s. I also used fonts and background patterns that are a little more gothic as well.
                In addition to all of this, I also made Madame Vita take after a flapper.

                Timeline: 1 Week
            </h3>

            <p>
                For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
                However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.

                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the first iteration of the game, before I cleaned it up a little, there was a button to the left of the stack, which the player would press to choose their cards. The playtesters
                thought they were supposed to press the card stack since it said to "choose" them. This was a small change I made afterward: making the stack itself the button to draw cards.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                The most difficult part of this game was the amount of writing I had to do for the fortunes since I don't write much. The pure volume of writing
                was enjoyable but took much more time than I expected.
