            Ideation
        </h2>

        <p>
            This was a prototype I made for a learning exercise based on a "Stacking" theme. I followed this theme
            by having a stack of tarot cards in the game.
        </p>


        <p>
            This game is different from my other games because of the aesthetic, which was very gothic and sultry. I also don't do many 2D games and I utilized a
            new drawing style when creating the sprite of Madame Vita. Below are
            some snippits of code, documentation of my ideation process, a reference.

            Emotions

        <p>
            For this game, I envisioned a very sultry, mysterious vibe. I created this kind of environment by taking a lot of inspiration from
            the 20s. I used royalty free 20s ragtime music and images from carnivals in the early 1900s. I also used fonts and backround patterns that are a little more gothic as well.
            In addition to all of this, I also made Madame Vita take after a flapper.

            Playtest Notes
        </h2>

        <p>
            In the first iteration of the game before I cleaned it up a little, there was a button to the left of the stack, which the player would press to choose their cards. The playtesters
            thought they were supposed to press the card stack since it said to "choose" them. This was a small change I made afterwards: making the stack itself the button to draw cards.
        </p>

        &nbsp;
        <h2>
            Challenges
        </h2>

        <p>
            The most difficult part of this game was the amount of writing I had to do for the fortunes since I don't write much. The pure volume of writing
            was enjoyable, but took much more time than I expected.
