                A cozy getaway with your bestie turns into a waking nightmare in this 2D point-and-click psychological thriller. When a young girl checks into a
                short-term rental a disturbing discovery—a hidden camera in the bathroom—unravels into something far more sinister. As paranoia sets in,
                you must unravel the truth: where has your friend gone, and is something far worse lurking just out of sight?

                Ideation
            </h3>

            <p>
                For the final project in my studio class in Paris, we had to create a piece that was informed by our experiences in the urban
                environment of this famous city. I decided to create a narrative point-and-click inspired by my experience traveling within
                France and abroad as well. I wanted to use my fears as a female traveler in an unfamiliar environment and take them to
                the extreme.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Emotions
            </h3>

            <p>
                This game, while unassuming and cute in aesthetic, unravels in a sinister way. The player is supposed
                to feel a sense of unease and disgust at the owner of the apartment. The main character has just arrived at this
                homestay to discover that her friend is missing and is potentially in danger. I wanted the player to be able to put
                themselves in her shoes and feel this fear while also gaining a sense of bravery to explore further in order to save
                the main character's friend.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Environmental Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                I illustrated all of the environments in this game, which was a huge challenge for me. I wanted to create an environment that seemed warm
                and inviting, but would ultimately become lackluster and more daunting. I was inspired by the show "Chowder," which has very bright and intricate environments.

            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, I had the pleasure of displaying this game at the Transitory spaces - Urban Reflections Exhibition at Galerie D in
                Romainville, France. I did a live playthrough of the game and explained the development process to an audience. Afterwards, I opened the floor
                to questions and let the game speak for itself by allowing visiters to play it.

                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                The players overall loved the narrative and the art style, finding both unique and engaging. The biggest issue with
                gameplay was the navigation. Ideally, if I was able to successfully implement navmesh, the player character would
                have navigated around obstacles when the player clicked somewhere on the screen. However, because navmesh didn't make
                it into the final build, the player movement was more restrictive.
            </p>


            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p>
                This game was overall very challenging to make because of the ambitious nature of my responsibilities as the only game designer on the
                project. I was spending a semester in Paris, so I didn't have any resources I normally have like professors and peers.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I stated earlier, the utilization of Navmesh with a 2D build was a big obstacle. I tried for many days to find an
                alternative, but was unable to without guidance from any of my professors.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second biggest challenge was actually the narrative. I thought the concept and storyline were very strong,
                however, I had to give extra thought to guide the player through the experience. What I didn't know I was missing was research on puzzle
                dependency in games.
