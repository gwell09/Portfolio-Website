            Ideation
        </h2>

        <p>
            This was a prototype for a learning exercise following the theme "Arcade". We had to work off of a classmate's game from another week and I chose my friend who had done a claw machine game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The twist I put on it was that I made it 2D and more story-oriented. The player acts as the parent of a little boy who wants a certain toy from the claw machine. He won't tell you
            what it is, but you'll know when you get it.
        </p>

        <p>
            This game is different from my other games because of this fun and creepy aesthetic. I also really delved into some intense 2D asset creation
            for this game as well, which I have little experience with. Below are
            some snippits of code detailing the function of the hand claw, documentation of my ideation process, and the sprites used.

        <p>
            the claw is a comedic, light-hearted game. The premise itself is an experience
            that centers around the weird toys you can collect and the reactions from the little boy. I did want a bit of a
            weird or creepy vibe, so I made the boy and toys a little unnerving.

            Playtest Notes
        </h2>

        <p>
            The biggest critique was the claw mechanic. The toy childed eachother instead of just the claw childing one toy, so the player could collect all of the toys and bring them to the
            outlet at one time.
        </p>

            Challenges
        </h2>

        <p>
            The biggest challenge was definitely figuring out how to create the working claw because I ran into the problem above. I tried many different ways to make this mechanic work, but the childing
            method was the best I could do by the end.
