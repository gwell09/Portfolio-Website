                In this rhythm-based psychological thriller,
                you must perform a flawless piano recital or risk succumbing to the crushing weight of your stage fright. As wrong notes stack up,
                your heart starts beating and even worse...the audience laughs at you? Can you keep your composure and make it
                through the performance, or will the fear consume you?

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Ideation
            </h3>

            <p>
                I created this game to try my hand at developing a rhythm game. Following an "Awkward Moment" theme, I honored this by creating a piano recital simulator.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had many embarrassing recital experiences in high school because I dealt with stage fright. Unfortunately, I would play half my song, forget the rest, and walk off stage.
                This was definitely inspired by those awkward moments of mine. This game is different from my other games because I used a queue to create a correct order of notes to be played and consequences for playing the
                wrong notes.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Emotions
            </h3>

            <p>
                The emotions I wanted to bring out of the player were feelings of humiliation and embarrassment. I wrote in actual music notation
                on the second page because I wanted the player to fail and this added a challenge unless you already play the piano.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted the player to be forced to experience those feelings of embarrassment and determination to try again.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Environmental Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                I focused on a darker color palette of reds and warm colors. However, I ensured that the lighting itself was cool-colored and
                also fluorescent to imbue feelings of anxiety and tension. I started the player out in a room that was relatively bare and devoid of people so that they had feelings
                of isolation from the start and to create a stronger juxtaposition between backstage and onstage.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Timeline: 1 Week
            </h3>

            <p>
                For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
                However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.
            </p>

            <p>

                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                The main critique for this game was that people wished they could see which note was being played on the keyboard, so I would like to update this game so the key either looks like it's being pressed
                or it changes color for a second when you press that key.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, some people agreed that the beginning of the game could use better lighting when walking from the backstage to the front.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                The challenge I dealt with in this game was using a queue for the first time. However, when it ended up working well, it was definitely worth it.
