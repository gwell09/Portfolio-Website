            Ideation
        </h2>

        <p>
            This was a prototype I made for a learning exercise following an "Awkward Moment" theme. I honored this theme by creating a piano recital simulator.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had many embarassing recital experiences in highschool because I dealt with stage fright. Unfortunately, I would play half my song, forget the rest, and walk off stage.
            This was definitely inspired by those awkward moments of mine.
        </p>

        <p>
            This game is different from my other games because of I used a queue to create a correct order of notes to be played and consequences for playing the
            wrong notes. Below are some snippits of code and documentation of my ideation process.
        </p>

            Emotions
        </h3>

        <p>
            The emotions I wanted to bring out of the player were feelings of humilation and embarrassment. I wrote in actual music notation
            on the second page because I wanted the player to fail and this added a challenge unless you already play the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted the player to be forced to experience those feelings of embarrassment and determination to try again.

            Environmental Design
        </h3>

        <p>
            I focused on a darker color palette of reds and warm colors. However, I ensured that the lighting itself was cool colored and
            also flourescent to embue feelings of anxiety and tension. I started the player out in a room that was relatively bare and devoid of people so that they had feelings
            of isolation from the start and to create a stronger juxtaposition between backstage and onstage.

        </h2>

        <p>
            The main critique for this game was that people wished they could see which note was being played on the keyboard, so I would like to update this game so the key either looks like it's being pressed
            or it changes color for a second when you press that key.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, some people agreed that the beginning of the game could use better lighting when walking from the back stage to the front.

        <p>
            The challenge I dealt with on this game was using a queue for the first time. However, when it ended up working well, it was definitely worth it.
