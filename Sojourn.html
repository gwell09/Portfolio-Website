            <h3>
                Ideation
            </h3>

            <p>
                I created this game in three weeks in order to focus on character modeling and explore environmental design. Based off the theme "Egg," I decided to create
                an experience where the player walks through a beautiful post-apocalyptic world and finds an egg at the end, allowing the player to fill in much of the narrative with
                their imagination.
            </p>

            <p>
                My primary goals were to model and rig the playable character and to dive into the environmental design.
                I was really inspired by the games made by Thatgamecompany like Journey and Sky: Children of the Light. I was drawn to these
                games because of their strong sense of aesthetics, which is dreamy, ethereal, and whimsical. I also like the minimal controls in these games.
            </p>

                <h3>
                    Environmental Design
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Some of the primary visual elements I focused on for this game were obelisk-like buildings that were so tall and featureless that they looked
                    foreign against the natural environment. Many of these buildings are buried in the sand or water and cannot be entered. They are simply relics
                    of the civilization that existed before.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Emotions
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The purpose of the tall featureless buildings was to create a sense of awe and make the player feel small in comparison. I wanted the player's imagination to run wild
                    thinking about what this world used to look like and how great the civilization was.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also wanted the player to feel relaxed and tranquil. This is why I stuck to different shades of blue and green. I made the environment
                    very rich in flora and gave the waves a gentle undulation to induce a calming effect.

            <h3>
                Character Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                My main aesthetic goals for the playable character were to have an androgynous, thin body, and a long flowy garment that
                moved when the player moved. I started by finding some reference pictures and then drew a sketch before beginning the model.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the final product, I decided to add a material with occlusion at max, so it glowed, which tied into a bit of the world-building.
                I simply used a free player controller asset from the Unity asset store for the controls and Magica Cloth for the flowy movement of the clothing.
            </p>

                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                The first two times this game was playtested, the biggest issue was the character controls because I coded them myself, but was having
                difficulty integrating them with Cinemachine. The part of the game, which was the most unenjoyable for the players was the platforming section,
                which was required to get to the top of the map and then descend down towards the temple at the end.
            </p>

            <p>
                The critique was that the camera had to be turned too much and the jumps were very narrow. When you jumped, if the player started to fall
                before they pressed space, the jump would not trigger. Because of this, it was difficult for the playtesters to make it through the platforming part.
                Because I had switched to a free asset, this was not something I could change easily, unfortunately.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                One of the biggest challenges for me was trying to get the controls to work well with Cinemachine. The other biggest challenge was modeling the
                playable character and rigging it. I had some problems with the model once I rigged it in Maya because I had some open seams apparently, which had to be fixed.
                However, I had a great professor who helped me fix any problems, so I was able to include it in the game.
