                A Walk Down the Block is a whimsical third-person adventure where you play as a baby in a city built entirely for babies. Parks are oversized playpens, sidewalks are cushioned,
                and cafes serve nothing but milky delights. Inspired by a long stroll along a canal in Romainville, Paris, this game explores how public and private
                spaces shape our interactions.

            <p>
                I wanted to go in a more playful direction with this game, so I decided to equate the differences between public and private spaces with
                adult and children's spaces. I started by organizing the most notable aspects of each group before moving forward with greyboxing, writing, etc.
                Many of these aspects are implemented through environmental design and audio. I also put together some reference games, which are all walking simulators.
            </p>

            <div class="gameDescript" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px;">
                I was inspired by walking simulators like Babbdi, Baby Walking Simulator, and Fish Market.

            </h3>

            <p>
                Ultimately, this is a funny, playful exploration game. Because the topic of design for the public can be very serious in some cases, I wanted to make the topic easier to digest
                by taking an approach, keeping humor and joy in mind. I wanted to make the differences between public/private spaces more obvious and lighthearted, keeping the intended audience
                broad and for many ages.

                Environmental Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                The environment was the most important aspect of the game in the design process because the game is focused on public/private spaces as well as the fact that exploration is
                integral in the gameplay. I first started by organizing the differences, so I could move forward with the environmental design.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created a map for the player to mentally note where they have explored. I wanted to keep the map as playful as the game itself, so I integrated colorful wood blocks into the design. This also
                creates more memorable monuments, which guide the player around the map.
            </p>

                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                This game did not have a traditional playtest experience because I was presenting to my class as a critique. I had a classmate play the game while I talked about it and
                occasionally jumped in to focus on a specific interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the overall experience was incredibly playful! The viewers and my playtester had a blast exploring and having wacky conversations with the babies. The baby flea market
                was everyone's favorite part of the map because it was so eccentric. I think focusing on the exploration and environment was a good decision on my part because the class
                enjoyed the game and wanted a larger map and more interactions. I would say it was a very successful prototype!
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                The biggest challenge for me was prioritizing certain aspects because I initially wanted to have experiences like meeting a boss baby in the office, doing graffiti with a baby on
                the side of the school, choosing a baby toy, and getting a fortune from a divination table, and more. However, I knew I had a short timeline for the level of detail I wanted to include
                in the environment.
