            Ideation
        </h2>

        <p>
            This was a prototype I made for a learning exercise based on a "In View" theme. I followed this theme
            by including a camera mechanic.
        </p>

        <p>
            This game is different from my other games because of the size of the map, which is rather large, and also the blue color scheme. Below are
            some snippits of code detailing the camera function and documentation of my ideation process.
        </p>

            Emotions
        </h3>

        <p>
            The emotions I was trying to embue in this game were feelings of awe and curiosity in the creatures the player
            may come across. I wanted them to feel like the environment they were in was foreign in its intense spirituality.
            The soundtrack and environmental design were crucial to cultivate these feelings.
        </p>

        <h3 style="padding:10px 20px">
            Environmental Design
        </h3>

        <p>
            I was interested in creating a mysterious, dream-like forest with a dark blue
            color palette and pitch black shadows. I gave the ghosts a bright glow in a variety of colors so the player is able to spot them in the dim
            environment and differentiate between different spirits.

            For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
            However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.

            Playtest Notes
        </h2>

        <p>
            The playtesters wished that they could have looked at the pictures they took. In the game, you take the picture and it
            disappears after. I was hoping to include a picture book that the player could access as a reach for this project. However, I didn't end up having enough time
            in the end.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Challenges
        </h2>

        <p>
            For this game, I was interested in experimenting with different shaders and post processing. I used some hologram-like shaders for the
            ghosts, but the post processing ended up being more complex than I expected. I also had a small issue with the image once the player took a picture
            because it looked squished, so it looked a bit funky.
