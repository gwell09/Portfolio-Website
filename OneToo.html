                A priest, a hangover, and a town full of questionable choices.

            <div class="gameDescript" style="padding: 0px 100px 40px;">
                A surreal 3D adventure where Father Laurent, a well-respected but deeply flawed priest, wakes up on the snowy outskirts of town with no memory of the previous
                night â€” only the bitter aftertaste of too much communion wine. With his belongings scattered across town and whispers of strange happenings in his wake, he must retrace
                his steps, overcome his hangover, and navigate the townspeople in order to sleep all of it off.

                Ideation
            </h3>

            <p>
                I created this one-week prototype to challenge myself by designing an adventure game that utilizes an objectives list and map. This game is based on the theme "One,"
                which led to me naming it "One Too Many," and forming the narrative around a drunk priest.
            </p>

            <p>
                This game is different from my other games because of the older European town style and this was also my first time adding a map that the player could use as well as
                an objectives menu that could be toggled.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Emotions
            </h3>

            <p>
                This game is supposed to be a bit more lighthearted. The storyline is humorous and the player is supposed to explore, tend to the objectives,
                and enjoy the dialogue from the other characters.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Environmental Design
            </h3>

            <p>
                I wanted to create a decently large map that took place in an older, possibly European town, with gentle snowfall.
                For lighting, I wanted the street lights to be the main source of illumination and the skylight to be pretty low. I was envisioning the time to be around
                5 am, when the sun is just starting to come up, but the townspeople have yet to start their day.

                Timeline: 1 Week
            </h3>

            <p>
                For each of my one week prototypes, the timeline typically includes ideation, greyboxing, environmental design, and delivery.
                However, since the timeline is so short, the number of days I work and the day each phase is assigned to varies.

                Goals
            </h3>

            <p>
                The primary goal of this game is to find your keys, so you can go home and sleep off your hangover. You have to go to different locations around town to find clues as to where your keys are.
            </p>

            <p>
                The secondary goals are to deliver flowers to a bartender you pissed off, pick up a hangover cure, and find your wallet. All of these goals are optional, but great for the completionist.

                Map
            </h3>

            <p>
                This was the first game I'd ever made where I added a map that was accessible to the player as a tool they could use during gameplay.
                I was careful to add some kind of important location or point of interest to every corner of the map, so there were no empty areas
                that the player would have to move through unnecessarily.
            </p>

            <p>
                The points of interest or important buildings also were illuminated and/or had an npc placed nearby so the player would know that this was an area to pay attention to.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Playtest Notes
            </h3>

            <p>
                The main critiques I got were about the controls. The game was difficult to navigate if you started halfway and missed the instruction screen. Given the fact that this was not an ideal
                playtesting environment where players would switch in and out without restarting the game, I would be curious to find a solution to this. Those who read this screen were able to navigate through the map
                and storyline with ease. It could be a nice addition to add a button on the top right corner where you can click to the menu, exit, start over, or view the instruction screen again.
            </p>

            <p>
                The players who did experience the entire game appreciated the map design and found it to be a very useful tool. I was pleased with this comment because I put a lot of thought into an effective layout.
            </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top:20px;">
                Challenges
            </h3>

            <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">
                The biggest challenge of this game was building the environment. I have never made such a detailed, large-scale environment and it took several days to get it where I wanted. Since the
                ease of navigating through the map was so crucial, I allowed plenty of extra time to ensure it wasn't going to frustrate or hinder the player in any way.
